# README

Reworked the app-in-a-day assigned by Bottega at 6 weeks. 

Original project REQs:
- Google Calender (possibly google maps API)
- Login/logout
- CRUD events
- An event must be approved by admin to be published
- Styling ala "devcamp"
- Users can mark event as favorite
- My upcoming events
- Reminder of event(email, sms, etc)
- Set RSVP (possible reminder)

## Things I got working:

- Database connections between Events, Favorites and RSVPs.
- Add and remove favorites and rsvps
- Have a user page display created events, RSVPs and favorites
- Display events created on the index page

## TODO:

- Google Calender (possibly google maps API)
- An event must be approved by admin to be published
- Styling ala "devcamp"
- My upcoming events
- Reminder of event(email, sms, etc)
- Set RSVP (possible reminder)
